    Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement:
    Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names(done during the code, not in particular parts)
    Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject: Making and Writing a second tidy dataset.

finaldataset: output of R script: download R script and execute it in R studio.
